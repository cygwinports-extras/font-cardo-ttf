ldesc: "Cardo is a large Unicode font specifically designed for the 
needs of classicists, Biblical scholars, medievalists, and linguists.  
Since it may be used to prepare materials for publication, it also 
contains features that are required for high-quality typography, such as 
ligatures, text figures (also known as old style numerals), true small 
capitals and a variety of punctuation and space characters."
